grokAssist is a simple Android WebView wrapper for [Grok](https://grok.com/), providing a lightweight way to access the Grok AI chat interface on Android devices, including those without Google Mobile Services (GMS). This app is built by adapting the open-source code from [gptAssist](https://github.com/woheller69/gptAssist), and we extend our gratitude to the original author for their foundational work.

## Features

- Loads the Grok web interface[](https://grok.com/) in a WebView.
- Simple and lightweight, designed for seamless interaction with Grok.

## Notes

- For initial sign-up or login, you may need to use a web browser, as some authentication flows (e.g., via X or Google) might require turning off restricted mode.
